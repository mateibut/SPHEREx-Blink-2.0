# Changelog

All notable changes to SPHEREx Blink. Dates are the commit dates (`git log`); the hashes can be looked up with `git show`. Numbers are in the documents
named next to them and come from commands that can be re-run. Nothing here is a release: the work after `main` lives on the branch `blink-2.0` and is not
published until the author decides ([docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)).

## Blink 2.0 (branch `blink-2.0`, not released)

The reference is `main` at `3f1e538` (7 Nov 2026). Status per phase: [docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md); feature by feature,
with what was and was not checked: [docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md](docs/FEATURE_STATUS.md).

### Release-quality checks (10 Nov 2026)
- `scratch/release_audit.mjs` (CI job `release`): 200 % and 400 % zoom, forced colours, reduced motion, touch on a phone, text spacing. **It found 4 defects** (the layer list and the Solar System date slider stuck out at 320 px; ten controls had no border in forced colours) and they are fixed. Not done: a real phone, a real screen reader, the Pages site on a real network. Item 10 of the ten improvements, partly.

### How often does chance do this? (10 Nov 2026)
- The explainer (section 8) has a fourth question with the measured empty-field baselines next to the candidate (`chanceBaseline.js`, `assistant-2`): shares of empty copies that listed a candidate by number of passes, and for a Planet X candidate the 27-41 chance candidates of 8 empty copies and the fit-rms hint; numbers checked against VALIDATION 12 and 20 by a test. The interpretation panel of the ten improvements (item 9 of the author's list).

### When a web service fails (10 Nov 2026)
- `serviceCall.js`: the failure of SIMBAD, SkyBoT, the IRSA survey search and the footprints is named (offline, timeout, busy, refused, unreadable), retried when that can help, limited in time, and the last good answer for the same field stays on screen marked stale; a Retry button, a Cancel button for the survey search. Item 7 of the ten; 8-10 not done.

### Provenance in every saved picture (10 Nov 2026)
- **Found:** the saved PNG and the recorded video carried no label. They now print a caption into the image (real, or SYNTHETIC and not an observation, plus field, detector, date, mode); `test_exportlabels.mjs` audits all 13 save points; 17th browser check. Item 6 of the ten; 7-10 not done.

### Cancel and size estimate (10 Nov 2026)
- Find movers and the Planet X search show their size and a rough range before they start, the elapsed seconds while they run, and a Cancel button when a worker runs them (`workerClient.js` takes an AbortSignal; `searchCost.js`; `test_cancel.mjs`; a 16th check in `e2e_smoke.mjs`). No real progress bar; Find everything and the dot detection are not cancellable. Item 5 of the ten improvements; 6-10 not done.

### Calibrated uncertainty and a broader blind check (10 Nov 2026)
- `features/uncertainty.js`: the error of a velocity split into statistical, excess scatter and systematic parts (nominal beside calibrated), and warnings for what could make a candidate less reliable; three new columns in the text-analysis table and CSV. `scratch/validate_uncertainty_real.mjs` tests the error on the six real fields with injected movers and 300 empty copies each (VALIDATION 20): **the error is too small in Barnard D2 (61 % inside 1σ), too large in Barnard D6, about right in four fields, with heavy tails; a false candidate can show 143σ.** The error model was not changed. The movers benchmark digest was rewritten because candidates carry four more fields (the digest without them is unchanged). Item 4 of the ten improvements; 5-10 not done.

### Reproducibility bundle, and a correction found by it (10 Nov 2026)
- Section 9: "Save the bundle (JSON)": the field, the versions, the settings of the last search, a SHA-256 of every image the search used, the candidates, a replay link and a command; `scratch/replay_bundle.mjs` reads the same images from a backend, compares the hashes and runs the same search (REPRODUCED or what differs). Item 3 of the ten improvements.
- **Correction:** the bundle listed the same image twice: the backend held three exposures of Barnard's Star in D2 twice (byte-identical files), so they counted as two measurements. The backend now skips exact copies (`/api/health` lists them: 75 files, 72 frames). Sections 1-6 of the results page were remade (Barnard reproduces the numbers of 7 Nov; the first run of the day, with the copies, had wrongly given 0.61 ″/yr); sections 8-9 and VALIDATION 10, 14, 16 were made with the copies in and carry a notice.

### Keyboard and screen-reader audit (10 Nov 2026)
- `scratch/a11y_audit.mjs`: 18 checks with real key presses in headless Chrome (also a CI job). It found and fixed: the image change was not announced (a live region now says it), measuring a position needed a mouse (the picture takes focus, the centre of the view is read out, Enter measures there), two targets under 24 px. Not listened to with a real screen reader. Item 2 of the ten improvements.

### Text analysis (10 Nov 2026)
- Section 9: the images, the dots and the candidates as plain tables, no picture, for a screen reader and the keyboard; CSV with the provenance first; checked in the browser, not with a screen reader. The first of ten improvements the author listed on 10 Nov (accessibility, provenance, uncertainty, validation, bundles, failure behaviour, performance, interpretation, release checks); the others are not done.

### Results page: sections 1-6 made by a command (10 Nov 2026)
- Sections 4-6 too (the Jansky scale, the asteroid Arosa, the WISE 0855 stack): most numbers did not move (WISE 0855 is identical to 7 Nov; the Jansky medians moved by 0.001; the Arosa flux errors are 10-30 % larger since the Phase 4 change of the flux error). VALIDATION 19.

- `scratch/make_results.mjs` remakes the numbers of sections 1-3 from the real images (the six blind searches, the original rule, the mask) into `real_results_generated.json`, laid over the typed file by the page; the page says which sections are made and which typed. The numbers moved (Barnard D2 0.31 → 0.61 ″/yr with 18 images instead of 15); the failure of the original rule can no longer be remade by the code and is kept as a record (VALIDATION 2.1).

### Survey coverage (10 Nov 2026)
- Section 6: *Which survey images cover a place?* A live search of IRSA's table `spherex.plane` through the backend (`GET /api/survey`): the footprints of the survey's images around a position at true scale, the images that cover the centre, in how many survey passes. It agrees with IRSA's own count at 7 of 7 comparable positions (`scratch/check_survey_live.mjs`, VALIDATION 18). The `e2e` smoke test has a 13th check (the button is disabled, with its reason, on the synthetic demo).

### Phase 10: hardening (9 Nov 2026)
- The two long searches (Find movers, the Planet X search) run in a module worker, with the same task as the fallback on the page when no worker can be had
  (`searchTasks.js`, `workerClient.js`, `searchWorker.js`; `test_workers.mjs`). The page records where the last search ran (`data-last-search`). `0c67f0d`
- `scratch/benchmark.mjs`: three deterministic scenarios with golden digests of their output; a test fails when a search gives another answer
  (`test_benchmark.mjs`). [docs/BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md)
- `scratch/e2e_smoke.mjs`: the page in headless Chrome over the DevTools Protocol with Node only (no Playwright, no npm): 15 checks on the synthetic demo; a
  separate job in `tests.yml` (green in CI on PR 2, 10 Nov 2026; the golden digests are identical on Node 20 / Linux).
- Documents: BENCHMARKS, DEPLOYMENT, CONTRIBUTING, this file.
- Measured and said: no search got faster; Find movers no longer stops the page (longest gap between frames 15-28 ms against 396-499 ms), the Planet X search
  gains little because the dots are still found on the page.

### Phase 9: explainer (8 Nov) `57bd456`
- Section 8: three questions about the selected candidate, every sentence citing the measured values it is made of, a validator that refuses a number that
  is not in what it cites. No language model, no key, no network.

### Phase 8: Solar System simulator (8 Nov) `3eb6cda`
- Section 7: a top view of the eight planets, scientific and educational ("NOT TO SCALE") modes, a distant body with the lines of sight on the survey dates;
  the planets checked against JPL Horizons (VALIDATION 17).

### Phase 7: sky explorer (8 Nov) `afddd59`
- Section 6: an all-sky map of the footprints of the image files, from their own WCS (`GET /api/footprints`, no path or file name served).

### Phase 6: spectral and multi-detector view (8 Nov) `6b11614`
- The six detectors side by side with the missing ones marked; the spectrum's uncertainty as a band that breaks where no image covers the wavelengths.

### Phase 5: Planet X Lab (8 Nov) `4adf08e`
- Section 5: which motion fits (stationary / line / line plus parallax, by BIC; the distance only when constrained) and how likely a distant body is to be
  found (synthetic bodies injected into the real images, in a worker; VALIDATION 16).

### Phase 4: positions, motions and fluxes with errors (8 Nov) `180d4ef`, `e93d2a6`
- Errors of positions, velocities and fluxes measured against repeated injections and real stars, and corrected (VALIDATION 15). A PSF-fit centroid that is
  worse than the windowed one on the real images, so it is off by default (15.7). A calibrated flux error for the backend's photometry.

### Phase 3: provenance, explorer, results page (8 Nov) `dead397`, `e559357`, `1a620a5`
- Provenance (input, settings, algorithm version, time) on every result and export. A candidate table with sort, filter, search and paging, and a plot.
  Every source of the six real fields on the results page (section 11); each of sections 1-10 names the command its numbers come from.

### Phase 2: workspace (8 Nov) `d6b76d1`, `c5441fe`, `4a7aab6`, `e907b68`, `c47f042`
- Zoom, pan, pixel and sky readout, scale bar, layer list (order, opacity), coordinate grid, centre or follow a candidate, a timeline by time and
  wavelength, three panels with an inspector.

### Phase 1: design foundation (8 Nov) `c910066`, `c9c3396`
- Four colour themes from CSS tokens (`?theme=`), a theme switch, tabular digits, tooltips that work with the keyboard, a modal dialog with the shortcut
  list, one box for empty and error states, icons.

### Phase 0: audit (8 Nov) `ea18243`
- PROJECT_AUDIT, ARCHITECTURE, FEATURE_STATUS, SCIENTIFIC_LIMITATIONS, the roadmap, AGENTS.md and the progress file.

### Find everything (8 Nov) `6dc79b9`
- Every source, vetted, cross-matched with Gaia, 2MASS, AllWISE and SIMBAD, ranked.

## Before Blink 2.0 (`main`, 5-7 Nov 2026)

The MVP (blink viewer, backend, stretch features), Find movers, real SPHEREx data support, the Planet X parallax mode, the results page and the first
validation on real data. See `git log main`.
