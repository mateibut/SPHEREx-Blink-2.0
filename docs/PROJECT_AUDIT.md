# Imported baseline

> **This file has two parts**: Part 1 is this repository's own text; **Part 2** (marked "Part 2" below) comes from the branch blink-2.0 of SPHEREx, merged on 10 Nov 2026. See [MERGE_NOTES.md](MERGE_NOTES.md).

On 2026-11-08 the outer nasa workspace had an unborn master, no files and no remote. The named Blink 2.0 remote advertised no refs. The development checkout imports the original repository and its history through 3f1e538. The original has validation reports, a CI workflow and application code, but lacked the four requested continuity files.

The last three commits cover real-frame mover calibration and a blind test (3f1e538), the results page and sky-map country readout (0c35bb6), and asteroid and brown-dwarf follow-up (aafd8e0). The results page fetches committed measurements. Opening it does not run the historical experiments.

Inspection found that the homepage hid its whole navigation below 721 CSS pixels, while results.html already had a keyboard skip link. These paths provided a testable first design-foundation change. Feature-level evidence and outstanding checks appear in FEATURE_STATUS.md. Production deployment, external catalogue availability and survey-wide performance have not been audited in this milestone.

## Part 2: the other line of Blink 2.0 (from the branch blink-2.0 of mateibut/SPHEREx, merged on 10 Nov 2026)

> Everything from here on was written for that line; where it describes something that Part 1 also describes, the two are two implementations, and [MERGE_NOTES.md](MERGE_NOTES.md) says which one the page uses. Numbers in Part 2 were measured with its detector; the cheap ones were re-measured after the merge (VALIDATION section 21).

# Project audit (8 Nov 2026)

What the repository contains **today**, checked by reading the code and running the tests, not copied from older notes.
Branch `blink-2.0` (from `main` at `3f1e538`; `main` is left as the reference and was not changed). Nothing here has been pushed.

## 1. Baseline

| Check | Result (8 Nov 2026) |
|---|---|
| Node tests (`scratch/test_*.mjs`) | 16 files, all exit 0, 480 `PASS` lines before Phase 1; 17 files and 526 `PASS` after it (`test_theme.mjs`, 46); 20 files and 651 `PASS` after Phase 2 (`test_view.mjs` 63, `test_grid.mjs` 26, `test_timeline.mjs` 36); 22 files and 740 `PASS` after Phase 3's first part (`test_provenance.mjs` 28, `test_explorer.mjs` 37, `test_results.mjs` 64); 23 files and **771** `PASS` after Phase 4's first part (`test_astrometry.mjs` 31); 0 `FAIL` (`test_coords` and `test_mock` print in another style and are not in that count) |
| Backend tests (`pytest backend`) | 146 passed after Phase 2 (143 after Phase 1, 112 before this work) |
| CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) | runs every `scratch/test_*.mjs` and pytest; **not run on the new branch yet** (nothing pushed); the action versions in it were written from memory |
| Browser check of the new panel (built-in browser, real data, backend on port 8003) | opens, runs, no console errors; 375 px wide: no horizontal overflow after a fix (see §4) |
| End-to-end browser tests (Playwright) | **none exist**: every browser check so far was done by hand or with small scripts (`scratch/audit_page.js`) |

## 2. Architecture in one paragraph

A static site of ES modules with no build step (`frontend/`, about 6 400 lines of JavaScript) that works alone on **synthetic** data made in the
browser (`js/data/mockSource.js`) and, with `?data=api`, on **real** SPHEREx cutouts served by a FastAPI backend (`backend/`, about 1 100 lines
of Python, astropy) that reads FITS files from `backend/data/` (git-ignored: the data licence has not been reviewed). The single interface
between the two is `js/data/getCutouts.js`. Details: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 3. Feature inventory

[FEATURE_STATUS.md](FEATURE_STATUS.md): one line per feature with status, evidence and known issues.

## 4. Risks and findings

**Fixed during this audit/work**

1. `apertureSnr` (`movers.js`) rejected about 2 % of pixel grids because its "no holes" test used 0.8·π·r² = 10.05 centres while some positions
   have only 10 (regression check in `test_movers.mjs`).
2. A moving candidate that was four dots of a fixed bright star (12″/yr, 6σ) was listed next to the fixed source (rule `isShadowOf`, flag
   `motion-disagrees`; VALIDATION §14).
3. The new panel made the page 14 px wider than a 375 px screen (a `<select>` sized by its longest option); fixed in `styles.css`.

**Open**

| # | Finding | Severity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Heavy searches (`findMovers`, `discover`) run on the **main thread**; no Web Workers | medium | fine on 5′ fields (about a second); not measured on 30′ fields with many images |
| A2 | A cutout of `det=all` is not the same pixels as one of a single detector (about 2 100 of 2 401 pixels differ: different resampling grid); marginal movers can appear in one and not the other | medium | measured in VALIDATION §14; all calibration used single-detector cutouts |
| A3 | `backend/app.py` has `allow_origins=["*"]`, no rate limit and no size limit on `/api/catalogue` (radius at most 25′, 20 000 rows, but each call can trigger a minutes-long upstream query) | medium for a public deployment; low on a laptop | the allowlists (`hips_proxy`, `catalogues`) stop it being an open proxy |
| A4 | The HTTP layer is tested only for `/api/catalogue` (called as a function); `httpx`, needed by FastAPI's `TestClient`, is not installed | low | |
| A5 | `docs/TODO.md` is in Romanian and dated 6 Nov: several statuses are older than the code | low | it is the submission checklist, not user documentation |
| A6 | No Playwright/E2E tests, no CONTRIBUTING.md, no CHANGELOG.md | low | |
| A7 | Eligibility: the project began on 5 Nov, before the hackathon; the official rule was not found and the question to the organisers is still open (`docs/TODO.md` §1) | **decision for the author** | not something code can settle |
| A8 | Data licence/acknowledgement wording for SPHEREx, Gaia, 2MASS and AllWISE not yet copied from the archives (`CREDITS.md`) | needed before submission | |
| A9 | IRSA's and Gaia's TAP services are slow or unreachable at times; a plain GET to the ESA service hangs from this network (the relay uses POST) | operational | the page reports what failed instead of falling back silently |

## 5. What was **not** examined

Accessibility with a screen reader or on a real phone (script checks only, [ACCESSIBILITY.md](ACCESSIBILITY.md)); other browsers than Chromium
(the built-in browser); the public GitHub Pages build; dependency vulnerabilities (`pip audit` / `npm audit` not run; there is no npm
dependency, the frontend loads Aladin Lite, `world-atlas` and Google Fonts from CDNs at run time).
